# Linear Regression
 Regression is a statistical way to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and a set of independent variable(s). e.g., if we say that

Age = 5 + Height * 10 + Weight * 13

Here we are establishing a relationship between Height & Weight of a person with his/ Her Age. This is a very basic example of Regression.

### Prerequisites:

To start with Linear Regression, you must be aware of a few basic concepts of statistics. i.e.,
      
• Correlation (r) – Explains the relationship between two variables, possible values -1 to +1

• Variance (σ2)– Measure of spread in your data

• Standard Deviation (σ) – Measure of spread in your data (Square root of Variance)

• Normal distribution

• Residual (error term) – {Actual value – Predicted value}

## What is linear regression??
Regression is a method of modelling a target value based on independent predictors. This method is mostly used for forecasting and finding out cause and effect relationship between variables. Regression techniques mostly differ based on the number of independent variables and the type of relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

## Introduction

Least Square “Linear Regression” is a statistical method to regress the data with dependent variable having continuous values whereas independent variables can have either continuous or categorical values. In other words “Linear Regression” is a method to predict dependent variable (Y) based on values of independent variables (X).  It can be used for the cases where we want to predict some continuous quantity. E.g., Predicting traffic in a retail store, predicting a user’s dwell time or number of pages visited on Dezyre.com etc.

Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable. The red line in the above graph is referred to as the best fit straight line. Based on the given data points, we try to plot a line that models the points the best. The line can be modelled based on the linear equation shown below.
