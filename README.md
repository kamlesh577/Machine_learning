# Linear Regression
 Regression is a statistical way to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and a set of independent variable(s). e.g., if we say that

Age = 5 + Height * 10 + Weight * 13

Here we are establishing a relationship between Height & Weight of a person with his/ Her Age. This is a very basic example of Regression.

## What is linear regression??
Regression is a method of modelling a target value based on independent predictors. This method is mostly used for forecasting and finding out cause and effect relationship between variables. Regression techniques mostly differ based on the number of independent variables and the type of relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
